# MIT Bus Tracking
##A simple bus tracker using data from the MBTA to follow busses as they move through the city.

This tracker will show the location of different busses along bus route #1 between MIT and Harvard in Cambridge MA. The locations of these buses are represented by small red markers, and will update every 15 seconds. 

##To Run
Pull down the entire repository, then drag index.html into a browser tab. The expected result will be a map of Cambridge and the surrounding area with small markers indicating the locations of all busses currently operating along the route. 

##Future Enhancements
1. The ability to change the bus route that is being tracked.
2. Changes to the bus indicator icons to make them more aesthetically pleasing.
3. An indicator that shows whether or not a given bus has moved or remained stationary over the past 15 seconds.
4. The ability to use this tracker in other cities with data from other metro areas.
